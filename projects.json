This codebase uses screenshots to check for fixed colours at set coordinates to calculate where the bot is, this is extrememly inefficient especially since it is handled externally using windows API to move the mouse & capture screenshots. I attempted a rework of creating a simpler game bot https://github.com/DNYLA/Stick-Hero-Android-Bot which connects to the ADB client and directly inputs with the android device/emulator. ",

The application was a food ordering app which had two seperate frontends for vendors & customers. A customer would order items that were available from a store of their choice and pay for their food which is processed via stripe. You can see from the codebase that i didn't understand that much about what i was using as the sockets connection works more like an API instead of an event based system.",

The gamemode was made as an improvement from other CQC gamemodes which have now died out, this improved version involves a better spawn system, simple vehicle spawn menu, teleporter and a new notification system. The notification system was also publicised, alot of arma 3 servers use my notification system & 90% of CQC servers are using an edited version of this mission file. I have done a few updates for this repo including a dynamic spawn system instead of having to copy and paste the whole file again however theese updates were paid updates that belong to a server.",
